## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
```go
// File upload flow
1. Client sends multipart file
2. Handler validates property ID
3. Service validates file (type, size)
4. Service generates unique filename
5. Service saves file to disk
6. Service creates database record
7. Handler returns success response
```

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// File upload flow
1. User drags/drops files
2. Component validates files
3. Service uploads files via API
4. Component shows progress
5. Gallery displays uploaded files
6. User can view/download/delete
```

### File Storage Structure
```
uploads/
â””â”€â”€ properties/
    â”œâ”€â”€ uuid1.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ uuid2.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ uuid3.mp4
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```
